Hi, I'm **Javier Hernandez Requena**, a cybersecurity researcher and technology enthusiast. I was born and raised in the SF Bay Area, California, and I have over a decade of experience working in hardware, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. I've had the privilege of working with various companies at different stages ranging from early-seed start-ups to established big tech corporations and everything in between. Some notable companies include Tesla, Amazon, Saildrone, and Tonal, just to name a few.

My passion lies in solving complex problems with innovative technology. Over the years, I've developed a deep understanding of cybersecurity and hardware engineering, with a focus on autonomous systems.

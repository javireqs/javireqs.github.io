Hi, my name is Javier Hernandez Requena, I'm a cyber security specialist with an emphasis on offensive security. 

My journey started on the hardware side over a decade ago building vehicles for Tesla. At the same time, I was attending Las Positas College where I was fortunate enough to be a part of an Engineering Technology cohort in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Lab. From there I worked as an electrician and then moved onto engineering tech work for various companies and organizations. Some of my hardware engineering experience includes Amazon, Saildrone, Zoox, Pyka, and Tonal just to name a few. 

In 2019 I joined City College of San Francisco's cybersecurity program where my curiosity for all things computer-related flourished. I began diving deeper and deeper into security, but realized that I wanted to explore programming as well. I received several certificates of achievement in C++, Python, Web-Development, and Security for Web-Applications. While attending CCSF, I joined the school hacking team and achieved 2nd place in the Global Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition's Western Regionals held at Stanford University.

Since then, I have started creating content and pursuing my bachelor's in cybersecurity and information assurance from Western Governor's University. This allows me to focus on honing my skills while building my own personal brand and business. I am truly grateful for the achievements of all those who came before me as it allows me to humbly strive towards excellence and innovation. Here's to the future!
